:dizzy: A Versatile Playground for Quantizing Object Detectors :dizzy:

This project is built upon [MQBench](https://github.com/ModelTC/MQBench)(V0.0.7) and [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/2.x)(V2.28.2), with adjustments made to the codebases of both and deep integration achieved. Experimental setups for Vanilla PTQ, Advanced PTQ, and QAT, among others, can be conducted based on existing Detector & Config. However, this framework is only suitable for quantizing detectors in an **academic setting**. Alignment and deployment across various hardware platforms are not currently supported.

[NOTE] Our code is currently under modification and the full version will be release no later than July. Please be patient and stay tuned. :astonished:
